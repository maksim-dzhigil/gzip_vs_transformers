As they say, the movie isn't for everyone, but it's for everyone.

Hirayama is a toilet cleaner. His life consists of a daily routine, in which he manages to find light, good and interesting. He is quite satisfied with it - he has a hobby - books "not for everyone" for 100 yen and photography. In the course of the story, the hero meets various people who reveal him as a character (first a lost boy, then a young colleague of Hirayama's who is his complete opposite in terms of temperament, character and hard work, a potential partner of this colleague - Aya, his niece, etc.).

To me, a very atypical Wim Wenders movie, though one can certainly catch motifs of the iconic "The Sky Over Berlin" and "Alice in the Cities" made by his hand.

From such movies I like to take out the moral, the meaning that the director and screenwriter lay down. This picture teaches to live in the moment and appreciate what you have, no matter how corny it sounds.
